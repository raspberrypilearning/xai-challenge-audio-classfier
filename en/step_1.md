## Introduction
Welcome to Stage 2 of the Experience AI Challenge! You're about to embark on an audio odyssey where we cross the soundscapes of voice, machine learning, and coding.

Ever wonder how your home assistant knows what you say and can respond? That’s all thanks to the amazing technical achievement of audio classification. Using machine learning, you can get a computer to process audio data and simulate hearing!

At the heart of this superpower is teaching your machine learning model what listen for. You have to tell it, “👆This way is *up*. 👇This way is *down*.” By processing the sounds lots and lots of times, the model start to identify clues – like tone, sound, and elements of speech – to detect patterns in the data and classify yours words.

And here’s the super cool part: once you get the hang of it with directions, you can teach your model to classify anything! Your name, certain songs or phrases, or even recorded animal and nature sounds! The sky’s the limit once you grasp the basics of audio classification. So, are you ready to give your tech some awesome “hearing” skills? Let’s jump in!

### You will

Using the Machine Learning for Kids platform, the Scratch coding platform, a microphone, and a whole lot of speaking, you will:
  + Build a machine learning model on Machine Learning for Kids
  + Collect audio data of the words `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right`
  + Train your machine learning model on your collected audio samples
  + Build an audio classifier application that can control a character on screen
